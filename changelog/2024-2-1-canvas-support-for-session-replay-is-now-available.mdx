  We're excited to announce canvas support is now available in beta for Session Replay videos. ![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emoji-datasource-apple/img/apple/64/1f389.png)\
\
For all websites/apps that leverage HTML canvas elements, you can now configure replays to show canvas elements. This gives you the context & insight you need to debug tricky errors in your application related to those elements, and better understand the severity of those errors.\
\
Here are the steps to get this installed:

1. Upgrade your SDK to the [latest version](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/releases/tag/7.99.0)

2. Set up [Session Replay](https://docs.sentry.io/product/session-replay/getting-started/) if you have not already

3. In `Sentry.init()`, add `Sentry.replayCanvasIntegration()` to your `integrations` array

For more information on how to set up canvas and optimize performance, see [here](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/session-replay/). Please note that there is currently no PII scrubbing in canvas recordings.

If you have any feedback or encounter issues setting this up, [please open a GitHub ticket](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/new/choose).
