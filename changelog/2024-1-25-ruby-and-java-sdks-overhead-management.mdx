  We are excited to announce the continued rollout of backpressure management to more Sentry SDKs. Now available on Python >[v1.30.0](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/releases/tag/1.30.0), [Java >v7.1.0](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/releases/tag/7.1.0) , and Ruby >[v5.16.0](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/releases/tag/5.16.0). This means no matter the load or your traces sample rate, our SDKs will ensure your applications stay humming.

Our Java and Ruby SDKs are still opt in while we confirm testing. Turn yours on by setting `enable-backpressure-handling=true` in your init for Java.

And for Ruby `config.enable_backpressure_handling = true.`\
\
In future releases this will be turned on by default to ensure everyone benefits. See our docs on [Performance overhead](https://docs.sentry.io/product/performance/performance-overhead/#will-performance-break-my-application) to learn more.
